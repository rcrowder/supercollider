PsyCollider 3.2 (Supercollider 3.2 for Windows)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the Windows version of James McCartney's SuperCollider synthesis engine (scsynth) and programming language (sclang). 
Supercollider's main homepage is at:

   http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/

To get further information on SuperCollider usage or development, you
should subscribe to the mailing lists:

   http://www.create.ucsb.edu/mailman/listinfo/sc-users
   http://www.create.ucsb.edu/mailman/listinfo/sc-devel

------------------------------------------------------------------------
System Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows 2000/XP/Vista
Windows Installer 

Sound card supported by PortAudio (http://www.portaudio.com/). If you have issues with latency, consult http://www.portaudio.com/docs/latency.html for advice how to tune your operating system to achieve the best results (in short: use ASIO drivers wherever possible).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simply run "setup.exe" and PsyCollider will install on your System (default is Program Files\PsyCollider). Start PsyCollider from your start menu. 


NOTE: Your system must provide both audio input and audio output. Otherwise the synthesis server will not start (see also sc-users mailinglist discussion)

Important paths and files:
$PSYCOLLIDER_HOME$\startup.sc : system wide startup file
$USER_HOME$\SuperCollider\startup.sc : user startup file
$USER_HOME$\SuperCollider\Extensions : user extension folder for classes, plugins and help files

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check out the latest source from supercollider.sourceforge.net 

The following libraries are needed for compiling
* libsndfile (included in the sc code tree)
* portaudio
* portmidi
* pthread-Win32
* fftw3
* python

You need Visual C++ 2005 (8.0) or the Express edition to build it. 

Let's call ROOT the folder you checked out the SuperCollider code tree (contains "build", "Source" etc.)

Python 
----------------------
1) go to "http://python.org" and download and install the latest Python version (tested 2.5.1). 
NOTE: get the Windows installer and make sure its the Unicode version and NOT the Ansii version.

2) go to "http://wxpython.org" and download and install the corresponding wxPython binary (tested 2.8.6.1)
NOTE: again you need the Unicode version.

NOTE: make sure you have an environment variable set called PYTHONPATH pointing to the base directory of you installation (Should be done by python installer).

Portaudio + ASIO
----------------------
- reminder : you do NOT need to build portaudio. this is taken care of by the msvc project.

1) go to "http://www.portaudio.com/" and download pa_snapshot_v19.tar.gz
(main page --> CVS (left menu) --> pa_snapshot_v19.tar.gz in the "v19-devel" branch section)

2) uncompress it in the ROOT folder. normally, the portaudio folder has the correct name "portaudio".
folders must be like that :

...
ROOT\..\portaudio\docs
ROOT\..\portaudio\src
....

3) go to steinberg.net --> support --> 3rd party Developers (menu on the right) --> ASIO SDK Download. 
If you agree on legal junk, you can enter a valid email address (please note that i do NOT know if you can safely Disagree with Steinberg sending your email address to commercial partners and receive the SDK info anyway...). 

4) once you receive the email (it took 5 minutes here), you can download asiosdk2.zip, copy and uncompress it to a temp folder. you must then copy some parts of the asio2 sdk to the PortAudio source tree.

5) unpack the zip and put it next to portaudio. 

...
ROOT\..\asio-sdk\common
ROOT\..\asio-sdk\driver
...

Portmidi
-----------
- reminder : you do NOT need to build portmidi. this is taken care of by the msvc project.

1) checkout version 8 from http://portmedia.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/portmedia/portmidi/trunk/

the folder structure needs to be like this:
...
ROOT\..\portmidi\pm_common\
ROOT\..\portmidi\portmidi.dsp\
...

Pthread-win32
------------------------
- reminder : you do NOT need to build pthread-win32. this is taken care of by the msvc project.

1) go to : "ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/pthreads-win32" and get "pthreads-snap-yyyy-mm-dd.tar.gz". (known to work with "pthreads-snap-2005-01-25.tar.gz")
uncompress it and rename the folder to "pthread-win32" so that the source tree looks like :

...
ROOT\..\pthread-win32\tests
ROOT\..\pthread-win32\announce
ROOT\..\pthread-win32\attr.c
...
NOTE : the home page is "http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32"


fftw3
-----------------------
- reminder : you do NOT need to build fftw3. this is taken care of by the msvc project.

1) go to: "http://www.fftw.org/download.html" and download the latest stable version (tested 3.1.)

...
ROOT\..\fftw3
...


Once all that is done, the Solution should compile without problems (lots of warning though...).
As a result you will have the plugins in build\plugins (scx files) and PySCLang in ($PYTHONHOME)\lib\site-packages

To run PsyCollider you have to put a few more things into the build directory:
* Psycollider.py (the Psycollider script from ROOT\Psycollider\Psycollider into ROOT\build\)
* startup.sc and keywords.list (from ROOT\windows\ into ROOT\build\)
* libsndfile.dll (from ROOT\libsndfile into ROOT\build\)

Then open a Terminal and run: python.exe Psycollider.py 


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Environment
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environment variables add directories to the default search path for plugins and synth definitions, respectively. Directory names are separated by ';' and must be set through the Control Panel. 

 * SC_PLUGIN_PATH, SC_SYNTHDEF_PATH

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporting bugs
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please report bugs either to the sc-users or sc-dev mailing lists.
