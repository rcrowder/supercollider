------------------------------------------------------------------------
$Id$
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
intro
------------------------------------------------------------------------

this is a port of james mccartney's supercollider synthesis engine
(scsynth) and programming language (sclang) to linux. supercollider's
main homepage is at and the source code can be obtained via SVN from

   http://supercollider.sourceforge.net

It all started at this homepage:

   http://www.audiosynth.com

to get further information on supercollider usage or development, you

------------------------------------------------------------------------
build requirements (debian users)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

on debian (unstable) you can install the following packages and be set
for building supercollider:

   gcc
   libjack0.100.0-dev
   libsndfile1-dev
   libasound2-dev
   libavahi-client-dev
   pkg-config
   scons

------------------------------------------------------------------------
building
------------------------------------------------------------------------

building with scons is not really different from building with
autoconf, automake and related tools.

   $ scons -H

gives an overview of scons options.

   $ scons -h

lists package specific options variables and their default values.

options can be set on the command line

   $ scons VARIABLE=VALUE

and are cached in a file called scache.conf (which can be edited with
your favorite editor) for use in the next scons invocation.

in order to build the whole package, call scons without arguments
(apart from option variables). in order to install the package, call
scons with the `install' target:

   $ scons install

any target (including `install') can be cleaned with the `-c' option
to scons; note that cleaning the `install' target also removes locally
built files.

The option SCEL installs the emacs editor. For the sced and scvim editors,
please use the scons scripts in their respective directories (in editors/).

Note that the language will only build 32bit. To compile the language as
32bit binary on a 64bit installation, a multilib compiler and 32bit
libraries are required (on debian systems, the packages are gcc-multilib
g++-multilib, ia32-libs, libc6-dev-i386 and lib32asound2-dev).


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building a Debian package
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In our SVN we have debian packaging rules. These were designed on Ubuntu 
but we believe they should work on most common debian systems - please 
let us know if you have any issues with this way of building:

  cd SuperCollider3    # (or wherever your SC source is)
  svn co https://supercollider.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/supercollider/packages/ubuntu/ debian
  debuild

Eventually, some .deb packages will be put in the parent folder, and can 
then be installed just like any other Debian package. For example:

  dpkg -i ../supercollider*.deb

(Note: the packages supercollider-scel*.deb, supercollider-scvim*.deb, 
supercollider-sced*.deb, represent the different editor integrations:
emacs, vim, gedit. You might not want to install all of those, but
choose your preferred editor.)


------------------------------------------------------------------------
running scsynth (standalone)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

run scsynth without options to get an option summary. don't forget to
start jackd before trying to use scsynth. if you want to add
directories to supercollider's search path or assign default jack
ports, set up your environment as described below.

you can specify the number of jack input/output channels created with
the options -i and -o, respectively.

the -H option can be used to specify a jack server to connect to and
to set the jack client identifier. the format is either

    <SERVER-NAME>:<CLIENT-NAME>

or just

    <CLIENT-NAME>

when connecting to the default server.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
running sclang
------------------------------------------------------------------------

it is recommended to use sclang in combination with the SCEL emacs
interface in `scel'. see the README in `linux/scel' for installation
and usage.

sclang executes the startup file `~/.sclang.sc' after class library
initialization. this file can contain statements you don't want to put
in a custom Main class, like setting default variables. an example can
be found in `linux/examples/sclang.sc'.

you _have_ to have a directory `~/share/SuperCollider/'. This is where
automatically a synthdefs directory is created. It is also the place
to put Extensions to the class library, in a folder called Extensions.

the runtime directory is either the current working directory or the
path specified with the `-d' option.

for advanced setups, sclang's compilation search path can be
customized with a library configuration file. an example is provided
in `linux/examples/sclang.cfg'; install it as `/etc/sclang.cfg' or
`~/.sclang.cfg'. This config file is only needed when you want to
_exclude_ directories from the class library. Otherwise (so in most cases)
it is not needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
environment
------------------------------------------------------------------------

the jack audio driver interface is configured based on various
environment variables:

 * SC_JACK_DEFAULT_INPUTS comma separated list of jack ports that
   scsynth's inputs should connect to by default

   $ export SC_JACK_DEFAULT_INPUTS="system:capture_1,system:capture_2"

   in order to connect the first ports of one jack client, it is possible
   to specify only the client name

   $ export SC_JACK_DEFAULT_INPUTS="system"

 * SC_JACK_DEFAULT_OUTPUTS comma separated list of jack ports that
   scsynth's outputs should be connected to by default.

   $ export SC_JACK_DEFAULT_OUTPUTS="system:playback_1,system:playback_2"

   in order to connect the first ports of one jack client, it is possible
   to specify only the client name

   $ export SC_JACK_DEFAULT_OUTPUTS="system"

two additional environment variables substitute directories for the default
search path for plugins and synth definitions, respectively. directory
names are separated by ':' as in the unix PATH variable:

 * SC_PLUGIN_PATH, SC_SYNTHDEF_PATH

   $ export SC_SYNTHDEF_PATH="./synthdefs:/home/sk/SuperCollider/synthdefs"
